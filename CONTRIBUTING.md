# Contributing guidelines 

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Reward's repositories. 
Please help future developers by keeping our codebases clean.


## Pull requests
Consider the following before making a pull request:

- [ ] Is this a breaking change? If so, have I considered the implications?
- [ ] If it's not ready for review - have I added 'WIP' (work in progress) to my title to prevent it being accidentally merged?

 ### âœ… Clean code
- [ ] Have I performed a self-review of my code (including spellchecking)?
- [ ] Does my code follow Reward's [coding standards]()?
- [ ] Do any database changes follow Postgres' [best practices]()?
- [ ] Have I [linted]() my code?
- [ ] Have I added comments to my code? (particularly in order to explain complexities I've added)

### ðŸ¤— Good practices
- [ ] Have I confirmed that packages/dependencies in this repo are up to date?
- [ ] Have I have added appropriate logging to provide traceability of my code?
- [ ] Have I have ensured that environment variables are correctly referenced (for all environments)?

###ðŸŽ‰ Well tested

- [ ] Have I tested locally (or where appropriate) to prove my code works?
- [ ] Do any new and/or existing unit tests pass locally?
- [ ] Have I confirmed that my changes don't generate new warnings?
